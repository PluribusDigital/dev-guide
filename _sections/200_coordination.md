title: Team Coordination
---

A team means you have to work with people, which requires communication and coordination.

### Key Concepts

#### Communication

**Standup Meeting:**

**Retrospective:**

#### Technical Documentation

A lot of open source software is written by people who don't work in the same office or timezone.
Over the years, they have developed some conventions so that anyone starting to work on a project can orient themselves.
Look for these files in any new project to get an idea of how to get started.

**README.md:**

At a minimum, most projects will have one of these files in the root.  Typically, it explains the project's purpose and how to use it.
It may also contain information about how to install or configure your project.

**CONTRIBUTING.md:**

This file describes how to contribute to a project.  It usually explains how issues are tracked, how pull requests are approved and any other code quality details like code coverage or linting.

**INSTALL.md:**

Some projects will have a separate file for installation instuctions.  The separate file will usually indicate a more involved build process or signal that the project has many more users than authors. 

### The STSI Way

At a minimum, the project should have a `README.md` file that explains how to install, build and run the project.

We would prefer a README/CONTRIBUTING/INSTALL set as [outlined here](https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md#level-three-basic-readme).
